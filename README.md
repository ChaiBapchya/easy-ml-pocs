## Add useful examples and organize within chapters
Then, create content pages inside the previously created chapter. Here are two ways to create content in a chapter with this hugo template:

> hugo new chapter/first-content.md

> hugo new chapter/second-content/_index.md

*So how do you use this to contribute examples?*

## If you want to contribute code:

1. Fork this repository or ask for access (this is better)
1. Select between preprocessing, training and inference
1. based on your selection above, create a new index file under this chapter and edit away. For example, to create a new preprocessing sub-chapter for personalize, do:


`hugo new preprocessing/personalize/_index.md'
